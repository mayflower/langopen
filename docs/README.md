# LangOpen Documentation

This documentation uses the Diataxis framework so you can choose guidance by intent.

## Choose by intent

- Tutorials: learn by doing with [Run LangOpen locally](/docs/tutorials/run-langopen-locally.md).
- How-to guides: complete operational tasks with [Deploy and run cluster smoke tests](/docs/how-to/deploy-and-run-cluster-smoke-tests.md).
- Reference: look up facts in [Platform components and interfaces](/docs/reference/platform-reference.md).
- Explanation: understand design rationale in [Architecture and compatibility model](/docs/explanation/architecture-and-compatibility.md).

## Quick repo pointers

- Project entrypoint and quickstart: [/README.md](/README.md)
- API contract source: [/contracts/openapi/agent-server.json](/contracts/openapi/agent-server.json)
- Cluster flow details: [/deploy/cluster/README.md](/deploy/cluster/README.md)
- Operational scripts: [/scripts](/scripts)

## Conventions

- Documentation is Markdown-first and stored in this repository.
- Source-of-truth implementation details remain in code, contracts, Helm values, and scripts under their original paths.
- When docs and code differ, treat repo source files as authoritative and update docs accordingly.
